# ML-Loan-Prediction
Loan delinquency predictive analytics using Machine Learning.
i was given a datasets that contained informations of customers that had been in an early due stages ( 1-30 days) and was told to determine the borrowers that are rolling forward from an early due stage to later due stages. I used python for data preparation and tried logistics regression and Xgboost for the prediction.
